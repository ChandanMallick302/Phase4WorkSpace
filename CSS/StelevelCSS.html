        A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors
        116). Length and appearance do not determine <b> <i> <u>section in a paper is a paragraph.</u></i></b> For
        instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence
        long.
